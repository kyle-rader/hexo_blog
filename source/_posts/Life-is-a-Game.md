## A frequent question
I have been asked more and more frequently over the last few years "how do you do everything?".
The question is not how. The question is why.

## Why?
A side note.  When I was 16 years old, early on in my [TED](https://ted.com) addiction, I watched [a talk by Simon Sinek](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action?language=en) which changed my life.  You should go watch it now, I'll wait.

## The short answer
The short answer to "how do I do everything I do" is that every moment and experience of my life has prepared me and shaped me to be exactly who I am today.  I was raised by disciplined but loving and involved parents both of which are engineers.  My dad starting teaching me how people think and introduced me to Zig Ziglar before I knew what was going on.  I learned early on to listen to people who are older than you.  I learned that in order to learn lessons you don't have to learn them yourself.  Of course the lessons you do learn yourself stick the best but a lot of lessons you can learn well just by listening to people who are older than you.  When you leverage the knowledge of other people's mistakes you can move much faster than you could on your own.  I took to heart Albert Einstein's thought that "you have to learn the rules of the game and then you have to play better than everyone else".  I also read [Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game) in the fifth grade and internalized the same feeling that Ender lived with.  No one is coming to my aid.  I have to live this life for myself.  But I found a trick.  To play better than everyone else you can leverage other people's lessons while only comparing youself to where you were yesterday.  Any attempt to judge yourself based on the people surrounding you is time and energy you could have spent playing the game.  This attitude makes me a results driven person.  I often don't care about being right or being pure, or proper, or whatever excuse you want to come up with.  I care about results.  
(In the event you do compare youself to someone else, be honest we all do it more than none, surround yourself with people you can learn from).

At this point, I've no idea what you're thinking about me.  You may be rapidly arriving at the conclusion many before you have come to... Kyle is a robot.  I don't care.  I care about results.  If everyone thinks I am a robot but the world is a better place because of it I will be satisfied.

Contrary to popular belief I'm not actually a robot.  To conclude the short answer - I am a highly motivated and disciplined individual.  So are you :)
