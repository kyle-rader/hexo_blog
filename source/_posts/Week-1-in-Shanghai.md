Week 1 in Shanghai has been interesting.  I feel completely disconnected from my surroundings not understanding 99% of what is said around me.  I've made a new friend from Germany who started working for the same company as I am.  We actually met when I visited previously.  She speaks German, Mandarin, English, and Turkish!  Thankfully she's been helping me quite a bit.  I got a metro card and successfully returned to my hotel 40 min across Shanghai.  This weekend I've been slowly building up the courage to go out in public.  I've managed to buy some food from a market and I am slowly gaining rapport with the staff of the KFC next door.  This evening I caused what seemed like quite a commotion when I said "woh yao bing shui" (I want ice water).  In China water is almost exclusively served hot or room temperature.  Thankfully when I walk in now, they quickly get out a laminated menu for me to point at.

I've decided I am going to get an apartment here in Shanghai!  Hopefully things will settle in at work and I can move into said apartment within a weeks time.  I long to get myself into a routine where I can focus on work, living in China, health, and my continued involvement with the WWU Puzzle Hunt (for which planning is underway for our 2nd annual puzzle hunt in 2017).  We have a long road ahead of us... I hope.  If it were easy, everyone would do it :)
